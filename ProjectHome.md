I play the lottery differently from most people.  I feel that, with regards to the odds of winning, the difference between holding one ticket, and holding two (or more) is so small that it is not worth the extra money to buy the additional tickets.  However, the difference between having zero and one ticket is huge, relatively speaking.

Using this philosophy, I usually buy one ticket per draw, as far in advance as possible, which is currently 10 draws.  I also usually get the Power Play option, because on the rare occasions that I get a few numbers correct, it multiplies my winnings considerably.  So, I normally spend $20 per month on Powerball tickets.  That's not much when you consider how much you spend monthly on, say, car insurance, which is basically just another way to gamble.

Anyway, I'd buy 10 draws per month, and would always forget to check my numbers every week.  It was a pain having to remember to check them, and find the historical numbers, and so on.  So I wrote a computer program to do it for me.  It's not much right now, but I'm planning to continue to add features as I get time.  Here it is, in all of it's shining glory. :-)

This is a simple program that will allow you to enter your Powerball numbers, along with a past, present, or future date. It will check them for you at the appropriate time.  You can download an executable JAR file (which also contains all of the source code) from the sidebar on the right under "Links".
